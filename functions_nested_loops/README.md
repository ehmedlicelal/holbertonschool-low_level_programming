C - Functions, nested loops

Small C programming exercises that focus on writing functions and using nested loops. Each file implements a compact utility or printing function to practice control flow and function design.

Files and descriptions
- `0-putchar.c`: Prints the character `\'\0\'` using `putchar` (task starter for output).
- `1-alphabet.c`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: Prints the alphabet 10 times.
- `3-islower.c`: Checks for lowercase characters (implements `islower`).
- `4-isalpha.c`: Checks for alphabetic characters (implements `isalpha`).
- `5-sign.c`: Prints the sign of a number.
- `6-abs.c`: Computes absolute value of an integer.
- `7-print_last_digit.c`: Prints the last digit of a number.
- `8-24_hours.c`: Prints every minute of the day in 24-hour format.
- `9-times_table.c`: Prints the multiplication table for 0–9.
- `10-add.c`: Adds two integers and returns the result.
- `11-print_to_98.c`: Prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`.
- `main.h`: Header with prototypes and common includes used by exercises.

Usage
- Compile single-file exercises with `gcc` or include `main.h` and a test `main` where appropriate.
