C - Variables, if, else, while

Exercises covering basic C constructs: variables, conditional statements, and loops. These tasks are designed to teach control flow and simple program logic.

Files and descriptions
- `0-positive_or_negative.c`: Determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.c`: Prints the last digit of a number.
- `2-print_alphabet.c`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- `3-print_alphabets.c`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase and uppercase.
- `4-print_alphabt.c`: Prints the alphabet excluding some letters (exercise variant).
- `5-print_numbers.c`: Prints digits 0–9.
- `6-print_numberz.c`: Prints digits using only `putchar`.
- `7-print_tebahpla.c`: Prints the alphabet in reverse.
- `8-print_base16.c`: Prints numbers in base 16 (hexadecimal).
- `9-print_comb.c`: Prints combinations of numbers.
- `100-print_comb3.c`: Prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
- `README.md`: This file.

Usage
- Compile each program with `gcc` and run to see behavior; these focus on learning flow control and basic I/O.
