C - More functions, more nested loops

Further exercises expanding on functions and nested loops. Focuses on creating small utilities, printing patterns, and using loops efficiently.

Files and descriptions
- `0-isupper.c`: Checks for uppercase letters.
- `1-isdigit.c`: Checks for numeric digit characters.
- `2-mul.c`: Multiplies two integers.
- `3-print_numbers.c`: Prints numbers 0–9 followed by a newline.
- `4-print_most_numbers.c`: Prints numbers except 2 and 4.
- `5-more_numbers.c`: Prints numbers 0–14 multiple times.
- `6-print_line.c`: Draws a straight line using `_` characters.
- `7-print_diagonal.c`: Draws a diagonal line with `\` characters.
- `8-print_square.c`: Prints a square using `#` characters.
- `9-fizz_buzz.c`: Prints the FizzBuzz sequence.
- `10-print_triangle.c`: Prints a right-aligned triangle of `#` characters.
- `main.h`: Header file with common prototypes.

Usage
- Compile and test each file individually with `gcc` or add a `main` wrapper to exercise functions.
