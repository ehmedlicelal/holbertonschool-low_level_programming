C - Pointers, arrays and strings

This directory contains projects that practice manipulating pointers, arrays, and strings in C. Each file implements a small function or program used to learn low-level string and memory operations.

Files and descriptions
- `0-memset.c`: Implements a custom `memset` to fill memory with a byte value.
- `0-reset_to_98.c`: Updates an integer's value to `98` using a pointer.
- `0-strcat.c`: Concatenates two strings (implements `strcat`).
- `1-memcpy.c`: Copies memory area (implements `memcpy`).
- `1-strncat.c`: Concatenates two strings using up to `n` bytes (implements `strncat`).
- `1-swap.c`: Swaps the values of two integers using pointers.
- `100-atoi.c`: Converts a string to an integer (robust `atoi` implementation).
- `2-strchr.c`: Locates a character in a string (implements `strchr`).
- `2-strlen.c`: Returns the length of a string (implements `strlen`).
- `2-strncpy.c`: Copies a string using at most `n` bytes (implements `strncpy`).
- `3-puts.c`: Prints a string to stdout followed by a newline (implements `puts`).
- `3-strcmp.c`: Compares two strings (implements `strcmp`).
- `3-strspn.c`: Gets the length of a prefix substring (implements `strspn`).
- `4-print_rev.c`: Prints a string in reverse.
- `4-rev_array.c`: Reverses the contents of an integer array.
- `4-strpbrk.c`: Searches a string for any of a set of bytes (implements `strpbrk`).
- `5-rev_string.c`: Reverses a string in place.
- `5-string_toupper.c`: Converts lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
- `5-strstr.c`: Locates a substring in a string (implements `strstr`).
- `6-cap_string.c`: Capitalizes all words in a string.
- `6-puts2.c`: Prints every other character of a string.
- `7-leet.c`: Encodes a string into 1337 (leet) speak.
- `7-print_chessboard.c`: Prints a chessboard represented by a 2D array of chars.
- `7-puts_half.c`: Prints half of a string.
- `8-print_array.c`: Prints the elements of an integer array.
- `8-print_diagsums.c`: Prints the sums of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
- `9-strcpy.c`: Copies a string to a buffer (implements `strcpy`).
- `main.h`: Header file containing prototypes and includes used across tasks.

Usage
- Compile each `.c` file with `gcc` and include `main.h` when required. These files are small exercises intended to be compiled and tested individually.
